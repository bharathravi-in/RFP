## Overview
Compliance checking ensures all RFP requirements are addressed.

## How It Works
1. AI extracts requirements from RFP
2. Maps requirements to proposal sections

### 2. Requirement Matrix
A detailed table of every requirement, linked directly to its corresponding proposal section.

### 3. AI Extraction & Live Scoring
