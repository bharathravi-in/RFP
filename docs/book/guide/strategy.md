# AI Strategic Dashboard

The **AI Strategic Dashboard** provides a high-level overview of your proposal's health, strategy, and risk. It helps proposal managers make data-driven decisions and identify areas that need immediate attention.

## Dashboard Components

### 1. Proposal Overview
- **Win Probability**: AI-calculated score based on project requirements and company capabilities.
- **Estimated Effort**: Total estimated hours required for completion.
- **Complexity Score**: A measure of how difficult the RFP is relative to past projects.

### 2. Strategic Win Themes
The dashboard identifies 3-5 key themes that will differentiate your proposal:
- **Primary Value Prop**: Your strongest technical or commercial advantage.
- **Cost Efficiency**: How you provide better value than competitors.
- **Risk Mitigation**: The key ways you address the client's biggest concerns.

### 3. Financial & Effort Estimates
- **Implementation Cost**: AI-estimated project budget.
- **Resource Allocation**: Breakdown of effort across Engineering, PM, and Support.
- **Timeline Forecast**: Projected milestones and delivery dates.

### 4. Legal & Risk Assessment
- **Liability Risk**: High-risk clauses identified in the RFP.
- **Compliance Gaps**: Areas where your product or service may not fully meet specs.
- **Mitigation Strategy**: AI-suggested wording to reduce legal exposure.

## How to Use

1. **Navigate to Proposal Builder**: The Strategic Dashboard is integrated directly into your workspace.
2. **Review Initial Analysis**: Once documents are uploaded, the AI automatically generates the first version of the dashboard.
3. **Refine Themes**: As you build the proposal, update the sections to align with your chosen win themes.
4. **Monitor Risk**: Keep an eye on the "Red Flags" section of the risk assessment as you finalize technical details.
